# Supplying-Leftover-Food-to-the-Poor
The project involves a systematic process of identifying sources of leftover food, such as restaurants, caterers, and households. It establishes a network of volunteers who collect, inspect, and distribute the food to shelters, orphanages, and directly to the homeless. To streamline operations, the project incorporates:

Technology: A mobile app or website to connect donors and volunteers efficiently.
Logistics: Real-time tracking and optimized routing for food pickups and drop-offs.
Safety Measures: Guidelines for food hygiene to ensure that only safe, consumable food is distributed.
